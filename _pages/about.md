I am **Brahim Mefgouda** a Postdoctoral Fellow at [6G Research Center](https://www.ku.ac.ae/6grc) at [Khalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/), UAE. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [National School of Computer Science (ENSI)](https://ensi.rnu.tn/), Manouba University, Tunisia, in 2023, and an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from [Biskra University](https://univ-biskra.dz/index.php/ar/), Algeria, in 2017. 


In addition to my academic background, I was a research visitor at the [James Watt School of Engineering](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/#:~:text=The%20James%20Watt%20School%20of,using%20engineering%20ingenuity%20and%20creativity.), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), UK. I actively serve as a peer reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences, including IEEE Letters and Communications, OJ-COMS, WCNC, VTC, and ICC, among others.


During my M.Sc., I explored the potential of computer vision to enhance the behavior of humanoid robots. My Ph.D. research introduced a novel approach for Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection employing decision-making frameworks and machine learning to improve connectivity in 5G heterogeneous wireless networks. Additionally, I applied  metaheuristic algorithms to optimize handovers, ensuring seamless performance in dynamic environments.
