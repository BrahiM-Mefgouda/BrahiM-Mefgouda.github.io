Network Interface Selection (NIS) aims to connect the user equipment to the best available network in the context of heterogeneous wireless networks environments (HWN). NIS is one of the main current issues in HWNs that raised great scientific interest in the last few years. Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) are the most common approaches applied to solve the NIS problem as they are easy to understand, they can be used in real scenarios, and they perform fast networks' ranking. In this paper, we apply, for the first time, the Combined Compromise Solution (COCOSO) to model and solve the network interface selection problem. Simulation results showed that our proposed approach outperforms the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) in terms of reducing the rank reversal problem and meeting QoS requirements.
