# Abstract
Internet of Things (IoT) networks have been deployed widely because of contemporary methods in which devices communicate. Device authentication in IoT networks is a crucial requirement that poses challenges related to security vulnerabilities, power consumption, and maintenance overheads. While cryptographic techniques secure device communication; storing keys in Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) poses challenges for edge devices. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) offer robust hardware-based authentication but introduce complexities such as hardware production and conservation expenses and susceptibility to aging effects. This paper proposes a novel scheme based on split learning, utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture at the device and server nodes to create a Virtual PUF (VPUF). The proposed VPUF reduces maintenance and power demands compared to the hardware PUF while enhancing security by transmitting latent space representations of responses between nodes. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VPUF scheme in modeling the behavior of the hardware-based PUF with added Gaussian noise. Furthermore, the authentication accuracy of the proposed scheme is 100%, as measured by the validation rate. This highlights the superior performance of the proposed scheme in emulating the capabilities of a hardware-based PUF while providing secure and efficient authentication in IoT networks.
